## What is Calyx?

Calyx is a simple and powerful software library for creating writing machines using the Ruby programming language. It provides tools for producing sequences of text using a syntax inspired by generative grammars.

Its primary affordances are for creating bots and weird combinatorial prose and poetry but you can use it to generate anything that has a textual or tree-based representation, including SVG graphics, narrative graphs and fake data schemas.

There are many useful and interesting methods for generative writing. The grammar-based approach is popular, widely studied and practiced, and easy to get started with.

Grammars offer direct authorial control over the fragments that combine to produce an output text. This involves more creativity and effort on the part of the writer but results in carefully crafted and expressive results which still have a capacity to surprise, delight, and confound—as any good text generator should.

## Orientation

If you’re new to Ruby and generative art in general, the [documentation for beginners](/docs/intro/beginners/) is a good place to start.

If you already know what all this stuff means, you might want to [learn more about the underlying concepts](/docs/intro/concepts/) or [install Calyx now](/docs/intro/installation) and get started with a [simple tutorial](/docs/intro/tutorial).

Use the [guides](/docs/guides/) to learn how to use the various features and capabilities of the library. For more direct and structured information, the [reference](/docs/reference/) contains a full breakdown of the syntax, API listings and links to useful resources.
